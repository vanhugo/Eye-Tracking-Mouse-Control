Eye tracking mouse control project

After running the program make sure you're in full screen on the window that pops up. Follow the moving red dots by holding your head still and only moving your eyes. After the calibration is complete you should be able to move your eyes to control the mouse, if it doesn't work try moving your head until you have control over the mouse. If you leave the mouse in the same spot for 1.5 seconds it will click. To quit the program the webcam window must be open and then press 'q'.
